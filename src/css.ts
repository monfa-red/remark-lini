 * The stylesheet the plugin ships with the figures it emits.

 * nothing else.
 *
 * It goes in `@layer remark-lini`, so any unlayered rule in the site's own CSS
 * wins without `!important`. Sites that would rather own the styling outright
 * pass `bundledCss: false` and ship {@link liniCss} themselves.
